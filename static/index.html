      <p>It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life. I care deeply for nature. Michael! Really? Did nothing cancel? No, I did not kill Kitty.

      <p>I'm afraid I just blue myself. Really? Did nothing cancel? There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it. <strong>Not tricks, Michael, illusions.</strong></p>
